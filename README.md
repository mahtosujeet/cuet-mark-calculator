# CUET Marks Calculator

A simple JavaScript tool to calculate your CUET (Common University Entrance Test) marks automatically.

## How to Use

### Direct Copy-Paste (Quickest Method)

1. Open your CUET result page in your web browser
2. Press `F12` or right-click anywhere on the page and select `Inspect` to open Developer Tools
3. Go to the `Console` tab in Developer Tools
4. Copy the entire code from the `cuet-marks-calculator-2025.js` file
5. Paste it into the console and press Enter
6. Your results will appear instantly both in the console and as a green box in the top-right corner of the page

## How It Works

The calculator:
- Contains the correct answer key for CUET questions
- Automatically finds your selected answers on the result page
- Calculates your score based on the CUET marking scheme:
  - +4 points for each correct answer
  - -1 point for each incorrect answer
  - 0 points for unattempted questions
- Displays a summary with your total marks, correct answers, incorrect answers, and more

## Important Notes

- This calculator works only on the official CUET result page
- Make sure to use the correct version of the calculator for your exam year
- Your data remains private as the script runs only in your browser
- If the result page structure changes, the calculator may need to be updated

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues:

1. **Calculator doesn't work**: Make sure you're on the CUET result page and that you've pasted the entire code
2. **Wrong scores**: Verify that you're using the correct version of the calculator for your exam year
3. **Console errors**: Check for any error messages in the console and report them as GitHub issues
